NOTES

Sounds
* First create a pygame.mixer.Sound object by calling the pygame.mixer.Sound() constructor function
  * It takes one string parameter, which is the filename of the sound file. 
  * Pygame can load WAV, MP3, or OGG files. 
* To play a sound object, call the Sound objectâ€™s play() method. 
  * The program execution continues immediately after play() is called; it does not wait for the sound to finish playing before moving on to the next line of code.
* If you want to immediately stop the Sound object from playing call the stop() method. 
  * The stop() method has no arguments. 
* Pygame can only load one music file to play in the *background* at a time. 
  * To load a background music file, call the pygame.mixer.music.load() function and pass it a string argument of the sound file to load. 
  * This file can be WAV, MP3, or MIDI format.
  * To begin playing the loaded sound file as the background music, call the pygame.mixer.music.play(-1, 0.0) function. 
    * The -1 argument makes the background music forever loop when it reaches the end of the sound file. 
    * If you set it to an integer 0 or larger, then the music will only loop that number of times instead of looping forever. 
    * The 0.0 means to start playing the sound file from the beginning. If you pass a larger integer or float, the music will begin playing that many seconds into the sound file. 
* To stop playing the background music immediately, call the pygame.mixer.music.stop() function.
